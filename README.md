# Machine-learning-projects

This folder contains various ML projects:

- **RF_MPL_0.ipynb** and **RF_MLP_1.ipynb** are two projects in supervised learning: the first compares the performance of a KNN with a Random Forest, the latter compares a Random Forest and Multilinear perceptron. Both on two different numerical datasets of modest size.

- **Risk+aversion+and+ambiguity+%28losses%29.ipynb** is a code for an experiment in Behavioral Economics, it basically analysis the answers to a survey based on testing ambiguity aversion for losses 

- **SVM+RF.ipynb** is a project which is based on comparing the performance of a Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Model on a numerical dataset

- **Satisfaction-meglio.ipynb** is a Time Series Forecast applied on Net Promoter Scores (NPS), the main objective is to fit the time series data to a seasonal ARIMA model
