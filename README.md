# Machine-learning-projects

This folder contains various ML projects:

- **K-means.ipynb** simple K-means implementation with randomly created data.

- **RF_MPL_0.ipynb** and **RF_MLP_1.ipynb** are two projects in supervised learning: the first compares the performance of a KNN  with a Random Forest, the latter compares a Random Forest and Multilinear perceptron. Both projects use two different numerical datasets of modest size.

- **Risk_aversion_&_ambiguity.ipynb** is a code for a project in Behavioral Economics, it basically analyzes the answers to a survey based on testing ambiguity aversion for losses 

- **SVM_RF.ipynb** is a project in which the performance of a Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Model are compared on a numerical dataset

- **Satisfaction-meglio.ipynb** is a Time Series Forecast applied on Net Promoter Scores (NPS), the main objective is to fit the time series data to a seasonal ARIMA model 

- **Open_industrial_data.ipynb** is a project regarding data originated from a compressor on an oil platform in the North Sea (still under progress)
